  "description": "This measure assesses the number of inpatient hospital days for patients age 18 and older with a hyperglycemic event (harm) per the total qualifying inpatient hospital days for that encounter",
  "purpose": "UNKNOWN",
  "usage": "The measure is using mg/dL as the unit of measurement for glucose results. Millimoles per liter (mmol/L) should be converted to milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) for reporting this measure. \n\nWhen evaluating for days with a glucose level >300 mg/dL, the first 24-hour period after admission to the hospital is not evaluated to account for potentially poor glucose control outside of the hospital setting or that preceded the start of hospital care. The admission starts in the ED or observation when the transition between the ED encounter, observation encounter, and the inpatient encounter are within an hour or less of each other.\n\nThis measure evaluates the first 10 days of an eligible inpatient hospitalization in determining eligible days for the denominator and numerator (i.e., the length of stay is truncated to <=10 days when the length exceeds 10 days). Patients admitted for longer length of stays are more likely to have more complex medical conditions.  \n\nIn determining eligible days for the denominator and numerator, this measure does not evaluate the last day if it was less than a 24-hour period.  \n\nThe “Days in Hospitalization” logic within Measure Observation 1 (associated with the denominator), in conjunction with other logic, returns the day number (e.g., day 1 to day 10) for each day within the hospitalization period to determine the eligible hospital days (e.g., from day 2 to day 10). \n\nThe “Days in Hospitalization” logic within Measure Observation 2 (associated with the numerator), in conjunction with other logic, returns the day number (e.g., day 1 to day 10) for each day within the hospitalization period to determine the eligible hyperglycemic event days (e.g., from day 2 to day 10).\n\nSince the measure does not count any hyperglycemic events that occur in the first 24 hours, day 1 is not considered an eligible hospital day for the Measure Observations. Eligible days range from day 2 up to day 10. However, the measure does allow day 1 to be counted for the Numerator as one of the preceding days for a day where no glucose result is found. In this instance, the measure could evaluate day 1 as one of the two days preceding the day with no glucose result to see if there was a glucose value >=200 mg/dL on day 1. \n\nMultiple hyperglycemic events can occur during a ‘day,’ but this is still considered one hyperglycemic event day.\n\nThe numerator returns the first eligible encounter that meets the qualifying criteria: an inpatient hospitalization with a hyperglycemic event. Only one numerator is counted per encounter. Note that the Numerator returns the encounters, not days, that meet the criteria. \n\nThis measure includes two measure observations used to calculate the ratio of the number of inpatient hospital days with a hyperglycemic (high blood glucose) event over the total number of eligible inpatient hospital days (<= 10 days) for that encounter.  \n\nIn ratio measures, both the denominator and numerator populations flow separately from the same initial population. Therefore, the same exclusion criteria must be applied to both the denominator and numerator to prevent excluded cases from being considered. \n\nThe specimen source for the glucose test is blood, serum, plasma, or interstitial fluid, and can be obtained by a laboratory test, a POC test, or a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). Glucose test results from urine specimens are not considered. \n\nThis eCQM is an episode-based measure. An episode is defined as each inpatient hospitalization or encounter that ends during the measurement period.\n\nThis FHIR-based measure has been derived from the QDM-based measure: CMS871v5.

  "rationale": "Hyperglycemia, i.e., elevated glucose level, is common among hospitalized patients, especially those with preexisting diabetes (Umpierrez et al., 2012) and accounts for over 30% of noncritically ill hospitalized patients (Korytkowski, 2022). Hyperglycemia can also affect individuals with no prior history of diabetes and may be induced by medications such as steroids or by parenteral (intravenous) or enteral (tube) feeding.\n\nSevere hyperglycemia, i.e., an extremely elevated glucose level, is significantly associated with a range of harms, including increased in-hospital mortality, infection rates, and hospital length of stay (Pasquel, et al., 2021; Umpierrez et al., 2012, 2015). Lower rates of inpatient severe hyperglycemia may not only improve care for patients but also may reduce costs for healthcare payers (Krinsley et al., 2016). The rate of hyperglycemia varies across hospitals, suggesting opportunities for improvement in inpatient glycemic management (Bersoux et al., 2013; Seisa et al., 2022). The rate of inpatient hyperglycemia can be considered a marker for quality of hospital care, since inpatient hyperglycemia is largely avoidable with proper glycemic management. The use of evidence-based standardized protocols and insulin management protocols have been shown to improve glycemic control and safety (Leroy et al., 2020; Maynard et al., 2015).\n\nIt should be noted that this measure does not aim to measure overall glucose control in hospitalized patients; rather, its goal is to assess the occurrence and extent of severe hyperglycemia. This measure is also intended to be used in combination with its companion measure of hypoglycemia (Hospital Harm – Hypoglycemia) to reduce unintended consequences of measurement.",
  "clinicalRecommendationStatement": "Multiple guidelines address recommended levels of glycemic control, though these do not define severe hyperglycemia: \n\nFrom Section 16, Diabetes Care in the Hospital, in the Standards of Care in Diabetes by the American Diabetes Association (American Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee, 2024): \n\n16.4 Insulin and/or other therapies should be initiated or intensified for treatment of persistent hyperglycemia starting at a threshold of ≥180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L) (confirmed on two occasions within 24 hours) for noncritically ill (non-ICU) individuals. \n\n16.5a Once therapy is initiated, a glycemic goal of 140–180 mg/dL (7.8–10.0 mmol/L) is recommended for most critically ill (ICU) individuals with hyperglycemia.\n\n16.5 More stringent glycemic goals, such as 110–140 mg/dL (6.1–7.8 mmol/L), may be appropriate for selected critically ill individuals and are acceptable if they can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia.\n\nFrom Management of Hyperglycemia in Hospitalized Adult Patients in Non-Critical Care Settings: An Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline (Korytkowski et al., 2022): \n\nRecommendation 1.1\nIn adults with insulin-treated diabetes hospitalized for noncritical illness who are at high risk of hypoglycemia, we suggest the use of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) with confirmatory bedside point-of-care blood glucose (POC-BG) monitoring for adjustments in insulin dosing rather than point-of-care blood glucose (POC-BG) testing alone in hospital settings where resources and training are available.\n\nRecommendation 10.1\nIn adults with no prior history of diabetes hospitalized for noncritical illness with hyperglycemia [defined as blood glucose (BG) > 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L)] during hospitalization, we suggest initial therapy with correctional insulin over scheduled insulin therapy (defined as basal or basal/bolus insulin) to maintain glucose targets in the range of 100 to 180 mg/dL (5.6 to 10.0 mmol/L). For patients with persistent hyperglycemia [≥2 point-of-care blood glucose (POC-BG) measurements ≥ 180 mg/dL (≥10.0 mmol/L) in a 24-hour period on correctional insulin alone], we suggest the addition of scheduled insulin therapy. \n\nRecommendation 10.2\nIn adults with diabetes treated with diet or noninsulin diabetes medications prior to admission, we suggest initial therapy with correctional insulin or scheduled insulin therapy to maintain glucose targets in the range of 100 to 180 mg/dL (5.6 to 10.0 mmol/L). For hospitalized adults started on correctional insulin alone and with persistent hyperglycemia [≥2 point-of-care blood glucose (POC-BG) measurements ≥ 180 mg/dL in a 24-hour period (≥10.0 mmol/L)], we suggest addition of scheduled insulin therapy. We suggest initiation of scheduled insulin therapy for patients with confirmed admission blood glucose (BG) ≥ 180 mg/dL (≥10.0 mmol/L). \n\nRecommendation 10.3\nIn adults with insulin-treated diabetes prior to admission who are hospitalized for noncritical illness, we recommend continuation of the scheduled insulin regimen modified for nutritional status and severity of illness to maintain glucose targets in the range of 100 to 180 mg/dL (5.6 to 10.0 mmol/L).\n\nRemarks\nReductions in the dose of basal insulin (by 10% to 20%) at time of hospitalization may be required for patients on basal heavy insulin regimens (defined as doses of basal insulin ≥ 0.6 to 1.0 units/kg/day), in which basal insulin is being used inappropriately to cover meal-related excursions in BG.\n\nThere is no clinically accepted cutoff for severe hyperglycemia. Studies have used thresholds of >140, >180, >300, >350 and >400 mg/dL, among other values (American Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee, 2024; Umpierrez et al, 2012, 2015; Jamesen et al., 2015; Donihi et al., 2011; Mendez et al, 2015; Seisa et al., 2022). Blood glucose level <180 mg/dL is associated with lower rates of mortality and stroke compared with a target glucose <200 mg/dL (Sathya et al., 2013). Glycemic goals may also differ among hospitalized patients. For inpatient management of hyperglycemia in noncritical care, the expert consensus recommends a target range of 100–180 mg/dL (5.6–10.0 mmol/L) for noncritically ill patients with “new” hyperglycemia as well as people with known diabetes prior to admission. Glycemic levels up to 250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L) may be acceptable in terminally ill patients with short life expectancy, patients with advanced kidney failure and/or on dialysis, patients at high risk for hypoglycemia, and/or patients with labile glycemic excursions. In these individuals, less aggressive treatment goals that would help avoid symptomatic hypoglycemia and/or hyperglycemia are often more appropriate (American Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee, 2024). In an older patient with a prior history of severe hypoglycemia, some degree of hyperglycemia may be tolerated to maximize safety. Intensive insulin therapy to target glucose of 100 and 140mg/dL in the ICU did not significantly reduce perioperative complications compared with target glucose of 141 and 180mg/dL after coronary artery bypass surgery (Umpierrez et al., 2015). The current recommendation is to maintain a blood glucose level between 140-180 mg/dL (7.8-10.0 mmol/L) in both cardiac and non-cardiac ICU patients (Sreedharan et al., 2022). \n\nFor patients who present with hyperglycemic crises, neurologic status must be monitored closely, with frequent re-examination. Care should be taken to prevent over-correction of hyperglycemia and hyperosmolarity following initial ﬂuid resuscitation of these patients to prevent cerebral edema, which carries a high mortality rate (Gosmanov et al., 2021).",
