  "description": "This measure assesses the number of elective inpatient hospitalizations for patients aged 18 years and older without an obstetrical condition who have a procedure resulting in postoperative respiratory failure (PRF)",
  "purpose": "UNKNOWN",
  "usage": "PRF is evaluated using mechanical ventilation (MV) documentation or intubation and extubation documentation to allow for hospital documentation variances. Therefore, if MV documentation is not available, intubation and extubation can serve as a proxy for determining if MV occurred and its duration. To determine that an unplanned initiation of MV occurred, the logic looks for evidence of a non-invasive oxygen therapy assessment such as oxygen via 'nasal canula' or 'breathing room air' prior to the MV occurrence to verify that MV was newly initiated. Additionally, facility location codes are used to determine if MV was initiated outside of a procedural area (e.g., medical floor). Conversely, to determine MV duration, the logic looks for evidence that a non-invasive oxygen therapy assessment or another operating room procedure does not exist prior to the MV occurrence to verify that MV was continued without interruption from a procedural area. \n\t\nThis eCQM is an episode-based measure. An episode is defined as each inpatient hospitalization or encounter that ends during the measurement period.\n\nThis FHIR-based measure has been derived from the QDM-based measure: CMS1218v2.

  "rationale": "Postoperative respiratory failure (PRF), defined as unplanned endotracheal reintubation, prolonged inability to wean from mechanical ventilation, or inadequate oxygenation and/or ventilation, is the most common serious postoperative pulmonary complication, with an incidence of up to 7.5% (the incidence of any postoperative pulmonary complication ranges from 10-40%) (Arozullah et al., 2000; Canet et al., 2015; Gupta et al., 2011; Kor et al., 2014). This measure addresses the prevalence of PRF and the variance between hospitals in the incidence of PRF. PRF is a serious complication that can increase the risk of morbidity and mortality, with in-hospital mortality resulting from PRF estimated at 25% to 40% (Arozullah et al., 2000; Canet & Gallart, 2014). Surgical procedures complicated by PRF have 3.74 times higher adjusted odds of death than those not complicated by respiratory failure, 1.47 times higher odds of 90-day readmission, and 1.86 times higher odds of an outpatient visit with one of 44 postoperative conditions (e.g., bacterial infection, fluid and electrolyte disorder, abdominal hernia) within 90 days of hospital discharge (Miller et al., 2001; Romano et al, 2009). PRF is additionally associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation and the need for rehabilitation or skilled nursing facility placement upon discharge (Thompson & Lisco, 2018).\n\nThe incidence of PRF varies by hospital, with higher reported rates of PRF in nonteaching hospitals than teaching hospitals (Rahman et al., 2013). Additionally, one study found that the odds of developing PRF increased by 6% for each level increase in hospital size from small to large (Rahman et al., 2013). This suggests that there remains room for improvement in hospitals reporting higher rates of PRF.\n\nThe most widely used current measures of PRF are based on either claims data (CMS Patient Safety Indicator (PSI) 11) or proprietary registry data (National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) of the American College of Surgeons). The eCQM is closely modeled after the NSQIP measure of PRF, which has been widely adopted across American hospitals, and is intended to complement and eventually supplant CMS PSI 11.",
  "clinicalRecommendationStatement": "Recent studies and current clinical practice guidelines for PRF have identified enhanced recovery pathways, prophylactic mucolytics, postoperative continuous positive airway pressure ventilation, lung protective intraoperative ventilation, prophylactic respiratory physiotherapy, epidural analgesia, and goal directed hemodynamic therapy as evidence-based interventions to reduce the incidence of PRF. Yet, progress in reducing the incidence of PRF has been stymied by lack of consensus regarding the definition of PRF, which patients are most at-risk, which risk factors are potentially modifiable, and which patients are more likely to benefit from targeted interventions of a health care system’s limited resources. This measure would address this gap in data.\n\nRelevant clinical guidelines for preventing postoperative respiratory failure can be found in the following:\n\n- Mohanty, et al. Optimal Perioperative Management of the Geriatric Patient: Best Practices Guideline from ACS NSQIP/AGS, 2016\n- Piraino, et al. AARC Clinical Practice Guideline: Management of Adult Patients with Oxygen in the Acute Care Setting, 2022",
