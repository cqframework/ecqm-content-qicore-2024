  "description": "The measure assesses the number of inpatient hospitalizations for patients age 18 and older who have an acute kidney injury (stage 2 or greater) that occurred during the encounter. Acute kidney injury (AKI) stage 2 or greater is defined as a substantial increase in serum creatinine value, or by the initiation of kidney dialysis (continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis).",
  "purpose": "UNKNOWN",
  "usage": "A patient characteristic of male or female sex is required as part of the initial population criteria, as sex is crucial to this measure. For example:\n- The eGFR estimating equation that is used to identify AKI is sex-specific; and\n- The reference ranges for the serum creatinine value are sex-specific, which matters because the serum creatinine must rise to a sex-specific abnormal value to be flagged as AKI.\n\nExclude encounters that do not have at least two serum creatine values within 48 hours of arrival. Two values are needed within this timeframe to determine if the patient has AKI or moderate-to-severe renal dysfunction on arrival.\n\nFor encounters for patients without harm, as identified by 2 times increase in serum creatinine, query for initiation of renal dialysis during hospitalization, defined by the start of dialysis occurring during the encounter.\n- If dialysis starts more than 48 hours after the start of the encounter, this meets numerator criteria.\n- If dialysis starts 48 hours or less after the start of the encounter, this meets denominator exclusion criteria.\n\nEncounters for patients with an increase in serum creatinine value of at least 0.3 mg/dL between the index serum creatinine and any subsequent serum creatinine taken within 48 hours of the encounter start are excluded. Due to the variability of decimal precision within programming languages and calculation tools, the value of >=0.3 mg/dL is expressed in the logic as >0.299 mg/dL.\n\nNote the measure is currently confined to using mg/dL as the unit of measurement for creatinine and mL/min as the unit of measurement for eGFR results. \n\nWhen reporting the first body temperature for risk adjustment, values from either Celsius or Fahrenheit readings are acceptable to report but Celsius readings are preferred. \n\nThis eCQM is an episode-based measure. An episode is defined as each inpatient hospitalization or encounter that ends during the measurement period.\n\nThis FHIR-based measure has been derived from the QDM-based measure: CMS832v3.

  "rationale": "This measure focuses on stage 2 or greater acute kidney injury as an outcome in the hospital inpatient setting. The incidence of AKI in general hospitalized patients is 10%–20%, and among critically ill patients, the incidence of AKI has been reported as high as 45–50%; in cardiac surgery patients it ranges from 30%-50% (Thongprayoon et al., 2020). Less severe acute kidney injury and acute kidney injury requiring dialysis affect approximately 2,000 to 3,000 and 200 to 300 per million population per year, respectively. Acute kidney injury may result in the need for dialysis, and is associated with an increased risk of mortality (Schwager et al., 2023; Wilson et al., 2013). \n\nWhile not all instances of acute kidney injury are avoidable and may be due to natural progression of underlying illness or a complication of a necessary treatment such as chemotherapy, a proportion of acute kidney injury cases are preventable and treatable. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines suggest careful management of hemodynamic status, fluids, and vasoactive medications for the prevention of acute kidney injury (KDIGO, 2012). Several studies identified through systematic literature searches developed or evaluated the effectiveness of acute kidney injury electronic alert systems (Schwager et al., 2023; Selby et al., 2012; Ahmed et al., 2015; Porter et al., 2014; Wilson et al., 2014; Kirkendall et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2012). These studies used data elements for defining acute kidney injury that were already present and populated in the electronic health record (EHR). For acute kidney injury diagnosis, all except two were limited to using serum creatinine levels, suggesting that this is the most reliable and consistently available electronic data element for defining acute kidney injury.",
  "clinicalRecommendationStatement": "Serum creatinine is an accepted proxy for acute kidney disease (Ostermann et al., 2020; KDIGO, 2012). It is cited by many guidelines for defining and monitoring acute kidney injury (Lameire et al., 2021; Ostermann et al., 2020; Lopes & Jorge, 2013; KDIGO, 2012). eGFR equations that incorporate creatinine and cystatin C but omit race are more accurate and lead to smaller differences between Black participants and non-Black participants than new equations without race with either creatinine or cystatin C alone (Inker et al., 2021).  As a result, a new race-neutral eGFR equation that that measures serum creatinine or cystatin C incorporate age, sex, and race to estimate measured GFR has been developed and is recommended by the Task Force from the National Kidney Foundation and American Society of Nephrology (Inker et al., 2021; Diao et al., 2021; Delgado et al., 2021; Delgado et al., 2022).  It was recommended by the Task Force to use within the measure a Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) creatinine equation refit without the race variable. This functionality has been available to all laboratories in the United States (Delgado et al., 2021; Delgado et al., 2022), and has acceptable performance characteristics and potential consequences that do not disproportionately affect any one group of individuals.\n\nThe KDIGO offers clinical practice guidelines for preventing and managing acute kidney injury:\n\nFLUIDS\n3.1.1: In the absence of hemorrhagic shock, we suggest using isotonic crystalloids rather than colloids (albumin or starches) as initial management for expansion of intravascular volume in patients at risk for acute kidney injury or with acute kidney injury. (Level 2, grade B)\n\nVASOPRESSORS\n3.1.2: We recommend the use of vasopressors in conjunction with fluids in patients with vasomotor shock with, or at risk for, acute kidney injury. (Level 1, grade C)\n\nPROTOCOLIZED HEMODYNAMIC MANAGEMENT\n3.1.3: We suggest using protocol-based management of hemodynamic and oxygenation parameters to prevent development or worsening of acute kidney injury in high-risk patients in the perioperative setting (2C) or in patients with septic shock. (Level 2, grade C)\n\nIn April 2019, KDIGO held a follow-up conference (Ostermann et al., 2020). The effectiveness of the 2012 KDIGO recommendations in preventing AKI was also noted to have been confirmed in small single-center randomized controlled trials (RCTs), such as the Prevention of AKI (PrevAKI) and the Biomarker Guided Intervention for Prevention of AKI (BigpAK) studies (Meersch et al., 2017; Göcze et al., 2018). In addition, results of RCTs have provided new data relevant to several facets of preventing and managing AKI, including early resuscitation, fluid therapy, prevention of contrast-associated AKI, and timing of acute renal replacement therapy (RRT) (Kellum et al., 2016; Nijssen et al., 2017; Self et al., 2018; Zarbock et al, 2016; Gaudry et al., 2016; Barbar et al., 2018).",
