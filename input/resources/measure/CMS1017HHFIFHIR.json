  "description": "This ratio measure assesses the number of inpatient hospitalizations where at least one fall with a major or moderate injury occurs among the total qualifying inpatient hospital days for patients aged 18 years and older",
  "purpose": "UNKNOWN",
  "usage": "Hospital days are measured in 24-hour periods starting from the time of arrival at the hospital (including time in the Emergency Department and or Observation).  The number of days will be counted as whole numbers; any fractional periods are dropped. For example, an eligible encounter with a length of stay of 75 hours will be measured as 3 days (72 hours).\n\nThis measure includes two measure observations used to calculate the ratio of the number of encounters with a fall over the total number of eligible hospital days. The ratio is reported as the rate of inpatient hospitalizations with falls with moderate or major injury per 1000 patient days. \n\nTo express the rate of inpatient hospitalizations with falls with moderate or major injury per 1,000 patient days, the following calculation is applied post-production during implementation: (Total number of encounters with falls with moderate or major injury / Total number of eligible hospital days) x 1000 = rate.\nExample: 1 eligible encounter with a patient fall with moderate or major injury over 120 eligible days (1/120) x 1000 = 8.33.\n\nIn ratio measures, both the Denominator and Numerator populations flow separately from the same Initial Population. Therefore, the same exclusion criteria must be applied to both the Denominator and Numerator to prevent excluded cases from being considered.\n\nThis eCQM is an episode-based measure. An episode is defined as each inpatient hospitalization or encounter that ends during the measurement period.\n\nThis FHIR-based measure has been derived from the QDM-based measure: CMS1017v2. Please refer to the HL7 QI-Core Implementation Guide (https://hl7.org/fhir/us/qicore/STU4.1.1/) for more information on QI-Core and mapping recommendations from QDM to QI-Core 4.1.1 (https://hl7.org/fhir/us/qicore/STU4.1.1/qdm-to-qicore.html).",

  "rationale": "Inpatient falls are among the most common incidents reported in hospitals and can increase length of stay and patient costs. Due to the potential for serious harm associated with patient falls, “patient death or serious injury associated with a fall while being cared for in a health care setting” is considered a Serious Reportable Event by the National Quality Forum (NQF).\n\nFalls (including unplanned or unintended descents to the floor) can result in patient injury ranging from minor abrasion or bruising to death as a result of injuries sustained from a fall. While major injuries (e.g., fractures, closed head injuries, internal bleeding) (Mintz, 2022) have the biggest impact on patient outcomes, 2008-2021 data findings from The 2022 Network of Patient Safety Databases (NPSD) demonstrated that 41.8 % of falls resulted in moderate injuries such as skin tear, avulsion, hematoma, significant bruising, dislocations and lacerations requiring suturing. Moderate injury is, as defined by NDNQI, that resulted in suturing, application of steri-strips or skin glue, splinting, or muscle/joint strain (Press GaneyI, 2020). NPSD findings also demonstrated that mild to moderate level of harm represent 24.2.%, 0.4% - severe harm, and 0.1% - death (levels of harm definitions developed by WHO, 2009). \n\nBy focusing on falls with major and moderate injuries, the goal of this hospital harm eCQM is to raise awareness of fall rates and, ultimately, to improve patient safety by preventing falls with injury in all hospital patients. The purpose of measuring the rate of falls with major and moderate injury events is to improve hospitals’ practices for monitoring patients at high risk for falls with injury and, in so doing, to reduce the frequency of patient falls with injury.",
  "clinicalRecommendationStatement": "Certain protocols and prevention measures to reduce patient falls with injury include using fall risk assessment tools to gauge individual patient risk, implementing fall prevention protocols directed at individual patient risk factors, and implementing environmental rounds to assess and correct environmental fall hazards. Recommended clinical guidelines and practices to reduce falls and injuries from falls in hospitals support many prevention activities including implementing multifactorial interventions and tailoring interventions to individual patient's conditions and needs. The intent and desired outcome for this eCQM is to work with existing and recommended falls prevention processes to track falls with injury, and aim to reduce rates of inpatient falls resulting in major injury.\n\nRecommended falls prevention guidelines are:\n\n- Optimal Perioperative Management of the Geriatric Patient: Best Practices Guideline (ACS NSQIP/AGS, 2016)\n- Falls in older people: assessing risk and prevention (NICE, 2013)\n- Preventing falls and reducing injury from falls (4th edition) (RNAO, 2017)\n- Fall prevention in hospitals and nursing homes: Clinical practice guideline (Schoberer et al., 2022)\n- World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: a global initiative, ('Montero-Odasso et al., 2022)",
