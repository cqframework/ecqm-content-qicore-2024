  "description": "This measure provides a standardized method for monitoring the performance of diagnostic CT to discourage unnecessarily high radiation doses, a risk factor for cancer, while preserving image quality. It is expressed as a percentage of CT exams that are out-of-range based on having either excessive radiation dose or inadequate image quality relative to evidence-based thresholds given the clinical indication for the exam. The higher the value the worse the performance. The clinical indication reflecting the underlying radiation dose and image quality required, is captured in a newly created variable CT Dose and Image Quality Category (LOINC Code 96914-7). All diagnostic CT exams performed in hospital settings (inpatient or outpatient) or ambulatory care settings are eligible for this eCQM based on physician level aggregation. A parallel eCQM includes only exams performed in hospital settings (inpatient or outpatient) that further aggregates into an inpatient or outpatient reporting level.\nAs a radiology measure, the measure derives standardized data elements from structured fields within both the electronic health record (EHR) and the radiology electronic clinical data systems, including the Radiology Information System (RIS) and the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). Primary imaging data required by the measure include the Radiation Dose Structured Reports and image pixel data, both stored in the PACS in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format, a universally adopted standard for medical imaging information. \n\nBecause of limitations in their specifications and format, eCQMs cannot currently access and consume these required data elements from these radiology sources in their original DICOM formats. Therefore this eCQM measure requires the use of additional software (translation software) to access the primary data elements that are required for measure computation and translate them into data elements that can be ingested by this eCQM. The purpose of this pre-processing software is to access and link the primary data elements with minimal site burden, assess each CT exam for eligibility based on initial population criteria, and generate three data elements mapped to a clinical terminology for eCQM consumption. \n\nThe translation software will create three variables required for measure computation including the CT Dose and Image Quality Category (LOINC Code 96914-7), the Calculated CT Global Noise (LOINC Code 96912-1) and the Calculated CT Size-Adjusted Dose (LOINC Code 96913-9). These transformed data elements can be stored in the EHR. The included population for this eCQM will include all CT scans with non-missing values of these three new variables where the defining of these variables, occurs in the translation software.\n\nThe measure will evaluate each included CT examination based on allowable thresholds that are specified by the CT dose and image quality category. An examination is considered out of range if either the Calculated CT Global Noise, or the Calculated CT Size-Adjusted Dose is out of range for the CT Dose and Image Quality Category. The following thresholds will be applied, shown with the following format: [CT Dose and Image Quality Category (longer name for category), threshold for the Calculated CT Global Noise in Hounsfield units, threshold for the calculated CT Size-Adjusted Dose in dose length product].\n[ABDOPEL LD (=Abdomen and Pelvis, Low Dose), 64, 598];\n[ABDOPEL RT (=Abdomen and Pelvis, Routine Dose), 29, 644];\n[ABDOPEL HD (=Abdomen and Pelvis, High Dose), 29, 1260];\n[CARDIAC LD (=Cardiac Low Dose), 55, 93];\n[CARDIAC RT (= Cardiac Routine Dose), 32, 576];\n[CHEST LD (=Chest Low Dose), 55, 377];\n[CHEST RT (=Chest Routine Dose), 49, 377];\n[CHEST-CARDIAC HD (=Chest High Dose or Cardiac High Dose), 49, 1282];\n[HEAD LD (=Head Low Dose), 115, 582];\n[HEAD RT (=Head Routine Dose), 115, 1025];\n[HEAD HD (=Head High Dose), 115, 1832];\n[EXTREMITIES (=Upper or Lower Extremity), 73, 320];\n[NECK-CSPINE (= Neck or Cervical Spine), 25, 1260];\n[TSPINE-LSPINE (=Thoracic or Lumbar Spine), 25, 1260];\n[CAP (=Combined Chest, Abdomen and Pelvis), 29, 1637];\n[TLSPINE (= Combined Thoracic and Lumbar Spine), 25, 2520];\n[HEADNECK RT (=Combined Head and Neck, Routine Dose), 25, 2285];\n[HEADNECK HD (=Combined Head and Neck, High Dose), 25, 3092]",
  "purpose": "UNKNOWN",
  "usage": "This is an inverse measure; as such the higher the value the worse the performance. The level of aggregation for this eCQM is the clinician or clinician group. Parallel eCQMs report CT exams performed in inpatient and outpatient hospital settings and is aggregated on the facility level. A single CT exam may be simultaneously measured in both the MIPS and one of the hospital reporting programs (inpatient or outpatient); however, a single exam cannot be measured in both the inpatient and outpatient hospital quality reporting programs. TRANSLATION SOFTWARE As a radiology measure, the measure derives standardized data elements from structured fields within both the electronic health record (EHR) and the radiology electronic clinical data systems, including the Radiology Information System (RIS) and the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). Primary imaging data including Radiation Dose Structured Reports and image pixel data are stored in the PACS in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format, a universally adopted standard for medical imaging information. Because of limitations in their specifications and format, eCQMs cannot currently access and consume elements from these radiology sources in their original DICOM formats. Thus, translation software was developed to transform primary data into a format that the eCQM can consume. This eCQM requires the use of additional software (translation software) to access the primary data elements that are required for measure computation and translate them into data elements that can be ingested by this eCQM. The purpose of this translation software is to access and link these primary data elements with minimal site burden, assess each CT exam for eligibility based on initial population criteria, and generate the three data elements mapped to a clinical terminology for eCQM consumption: CT Dose and Image Quality Category, Calculated CT Size-Adjusted Dose, and Calculated CT Global Noise. The translation software necessary to use this eCQM is written and maintained by Alara Imaging, Inc. CODING The translation software will create three variables required for measure computation including the CT Dose and Image Quality Category (LOINC Code 96914-7), the Calculated CT Global Noise (LOINC(R) Code 96912-1) and the Calculated CT Size-Adjusted Dose (LOINC(R) Code 96913-9). These variables are defined in the Definition field above. These transformed data elements can be stored in the EHR. MEASURE CALCULATION The measure will evaluate each included CT exam based on allowable thresholds that are specified by the CT Dose and Image Quality Category. An exam is considered out of range if either the Calculated CT Global Noise or the Calculated CT Size-Adjusted Dose is out of range for the CT Dose and Image Quality Category. Exams will be evaluated against their corresponding threshold, shown below with the following format: [Category shorthand (=CT Dose and Image Quality Category), threshold for the Calculated CT Global Noise in Hounsfield units, threshold for the Calculated CT Size-Adjusted Dose in dose length product]. [ABDOPEL LD (=Abdomen and Pelvis, Low Dose), 64, 598]; [ABDOPEL RT (=Abdomen and Pelvis, Routine Dose), 29, 644]; [ABDOPEL HD (=Abdomen and Pelvis, High Dose), 29, 1260]; [CARDIAC LD (=Cardiac Low Dose), 55, 93]; [CARDIAC RT (=Cardiac Routine Dose), 32, 576]; [CHEST LD (=Chest Low Dose), 55, 377]; [CHEST RT (=Chest Routine Dose), 49, 377]; [CHEST-CARDIAC HD (=Chest High Dose or Cardiac High Dose), 49, 1282]; [HEAD LD (=Head Low Dose), 115, 582]; [HEAD RT (=Head Routine Dose), 115, 1025]; [HEAD HD (=Head High Dose), 115, 1832]; [EXTREMITIES (=Upper or Lower Extremity), 73, 320]; [NECK-CSPINE (=Neck or Cervical Spine), 25, 1260]; [TSPINE-LSPINE (=Thoracic or Lumbar Spine), 25, 1260]; [CAP (=Combined Chest, Abdomen and Pelvis), 29, 1637]; [TLSPINE (=Combined Thoracic and Lumbar Spine), 25, 2520]; [HEADNECK RT (=Combined Head and Neck, Routine Dose), 25, 2285]; [HEADNECK HD (=Combined Head and Neck, High Dose), 25, 3092] EXCLUSIONS CT scans with missing patient age or missing CT Dose and Image Quality Category (LOINC(R) 96914-7) are excluded from the initial population. CT scans with a missing Calculated Global Noise value or a missing Calculated CT Size-Adjusted Dose value are not included in the denominator. CT scans assigned a CT Dose and Image Quality Category (LOINC(R) 96914-7) value using the LOINC(R) answer list (LL5824-9) of full body (LA31771-1) are excluded from the denominator. These exams are included in the initial population because they have a non-missing CT Dose and Image Quality Category but are then removed as a Denominator Exclusion in the eCQM because the value is full body, which reflects CT exams that cannot be categorized by anatomical area or by clinical indication, either because they are simultaneous exams of multiple body regions outside of four commonly encountered multiple region groupings, or because there is insufficient data for their classification based on the given diagnosis and procedure codes.\n\nThis eCQM is a patient based measure and should report the percentage of patients that had an eligible CT scan performed during the measurement period that had either a size adjusted dose or noise level out of range. Telehealth encounters are not eligible for this measure because the measure does not contain telehealth-eligible encounter codes.\nThis FHIR-based measure has been derived from the QDM-based measure: CMS1056v1\nPlease refer to the HL7 QI-Core Implementation Guide\n(http://hl7.org/fhir/us/qicore/index.html) for more information on QI-Core and mapping\nrecommendations from QDM to QI-Core 4.1.1 (http://hl7.org/fhir/us/qicore/qdm-to-\nqicore.html).",

  "rationale": "Diagnostic imaging using CT occurs in more than a third of acute care hospitalizations in the U.S. (Vance 2013) and greater than 90 million scans are performed annually in the U.S. (IMV 2020). There is marked observed variation in the radiation doses used to perform these exams (Smith-Bindman 2009, Smith-Bindman 2019). The inconsistency in how CT exams are performed represents a significant, unnecessary, and modifiable iatrogenic health risk, as there is extensive epidemiological and biological evidence that suggests exposure to radiation in the same range as that routinely delivered by CT increases a person's risk of developing cancer (Board of Radiation Effects 2006, Pearce 2012, Pierce 2000, Preston 2007, Brenner 2003, Hong 2019). It is estimated that 2% (37,000) of the 1.8 million cancers diagnosed annually in the U.S. are caused by CT exams (Berrington de Gonzalez 2009, NCI Cancer Statistics). \n\nThe measure focuses on reducing radiation dose in CT, an intermediate outcome directly and proportionally related to cancer prevention. As radiation dose is known to be directly related and proportional to future cancer risk (Board of Radiation Effects, Pearce, Pierce, Preston, Brenner, Hong, Berrington de Gonzalez), any reduction in radiation exposure would be expected to lead to a proportional reduction in cancers. Research suggests that when healthcare organizations and clinicians are provided with a summary of their CT radiation doses, their subsequent doses can be reduced without changing the usefulness of these tests (Smith-Bindman 2020). \n\nOn the basis of the current estimated number of CT scans performed annually in the U.S. (IMV 2020), distribution in scan types and observed doses (Demb 2017, Smith-Bindman 2019), modelling of the cancer risk associated with CT at different ages of exposure (Berrington de Gonzalez 2009), and costs of cancer care (Dieguez 2017, Mariotto 2011), an estimated 13,982 cancers could be prevented among Medicare beneficiaries annually, resulting in $1.86 billion to $5.21 billion annual cost savings.  \n\nThe measure aligns with numerous evidence- and consensus-based clinical guidelines asking radiologists to track, optimize, and lower CT radiation doses, guidelines that have been written by the American College of Radiology (American College of Radiology 2015 and Kanal 2019), the Radiology Society of North America (Hricak 2010), The Society of Interventional Radiology (Stecker 2009), The Society of Cardiovascular CT (Halliburton 2011), Cardiovascular imaging societies (Writing Committee Hirshfeld 2018), Image Wisely 2020 (a joint initiative of the American College of Radiology, Radiological Society of North America, American Society of Radiological Technologists, and American Association of Physicists in Medicine), and the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration 2019).",
  "clinicalRecommendationStatement": "This measure has been strongly supported by a Technical Expert Panel comprising a diverse group of clinicians, patient advocates, and leaders of medical specialty societies, payers, and healthcare safety and accrediting organizations, all of whom were engaged through every stage of measure conceptualization, development, and testing. In assessing the face validity of the measure, 100% of TEP members agreed radiation dose and global noise are relevant metrics of CT quality, that size is an appropriate method of risk adjustment, and that performance on this measure of radiation dose and image quality as specified is a representation of quality.",
