<th scope="row" class="row-header">Rationale</th>

<td class="content-container">The removal of any pressure to not perform a cesarean birth has led to a skyrocketing of hospital, state and national cesarean birth (CB) rates. Some hospitals’ CB rates were over 50%. Hospitals with CB rates at 15-20% have infant outcomes that are just as good and better maternal outcomes (Symum &amp; Zayas-Castro, 2023). There is no data that higher rates improve any outcomes, yet the CB rates continue to rise (Bailit, Garrett, Miller, McMahon, &amp; Cefalo, 2002; Main, Bloomfield, &amp; Hunt, 2004). This measure seeks to focus attention on the most variable portion of the CB epidemic, the term labor CB in nulliparous patients. This population segment accounts for the large majority of the variable portion of the CB rate and is the area most affected by subjectivity.

As compared to other CB measures, what is different about Nulliparous, Term, Singleton, Vertex (NTSV) CB rate is that there are clear cut quality improvement activities that can be done to address the differences. Main et al. (2012) found that over 60% of the variation among hospitals can be attributed to first birth labor induction rates and first birth early labor admission rates (Main et al., 2006). The results showed if labor was forced when the cervix was not ready the outcomes were poorer. Rosenstein et al. (2021) also showed that labor and delivery guidelines can make a difference in labor outcomes. Many authors have shown that physician factors, rather than patient characteristics or obstetric diagnoses are the major drivers for the difference in rates within a hospital (Berkowitz, Fiarman, Mojica, Bauman, &amp; de Regt, 1989; Goyert, Bottoms, Treadwell, &amp; Nehra, 1989; Luthy, Malmgren, Zingheim, &amp; Leininger, 2003; Symum &amp; Zayas-Castro, 2023; Main et al., 2006). The dramatic variation in cesarean rates seen in all populations studied is striking. Cesarean rates varied tenfold in US hospitals nationwide across hospitals (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ], 2002), from 7.1% to 69.9%, and there was a 15-fold variation among low-risk women, from 2.4% to 36.5% (Kozhimannil, Law, &amp; Virnig, 2013).

A reduction in the number of NTSV patients delivering by cesarean birth will result in increased patient safety, a substantial decrease in maternal and neonatal morbidity and substantial savings in health care costs (Main et al., 2019). Successful quality improvement efforts incorporate audit and feedback strategies combined with provider and nurse education, guidelines and peer review.

The measure will assist health care organizations to track NTSV patients delivering by cesarean birth to reduce the occurrence. Nulliparous patients have 4-6 times the cesarean birth rate than multiparous patients thus the NTSV population is the largest driver of primary cesarean birth rate (Sakala, Belanoff, Declercq, 2020). NTSV has a large variation among facilities, thus identifying an important population on which to focus quality improvement efforts.

In accordance with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommendations (2020), cesarean delivery is indicated for patients with active genital lesions of genital herpes or prodromal symptoms (i.e., vulvar pain or burning at delivery) that may indicate viral shedding. Therefore, the measure will exclude encounters with a diagnosis of active genital herpes.

In addition, the accepted approach to treat placenta accreta spectrum, or the range of pathologic adherence of the placenta that includes placenta increta, placenta percreta, and placenta accreta, as well as placenta previa, is cesarean delivery (ACOG &amp; Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM), 2018). Vasa previa is an indication for cesarean delivery (SMFM Publications Committee, Sinkey, Odibo, &amp; Dashe, 2015). Accordingly, placenta previa, vasa previa, and placenta accreta spectrum are all qualifying conditions to also be excluded from the measure. 

Ultimately, a reduction in primary cesarean births will reduce the number of patients having repeat cesarean births (almost 90% of mothers who have a primary cesarean birth will have subsequent cesarean birth (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020)). Thus, improvement in the rates of cesarean delivery for the first birth will reduce the morbidity of all future births and avoid all the controversies with trial of labor after cesarean/elective repeat cesarean deliveries.</td>

<td class="content-container">The (ACOG) report, Evaluation of Cesarean Delivery (2000), recognizes the importance of the Nulliparous, Term, Singleton, Vertex (NTSV) population as the optimal focus for measurement and quality improvement action. A reduction in the number of nulliparous patients with live term singleton newborns in vertex position delivering by cesarean birth will result in increased patient safety, a substantial decrease in maternal and neonatal morbidity and substantial savings in health care costs.</td>

<th scope="row" class="row-header">Guidance</th>

<td class="content-container">Vertex position is modeled implicitly, as the measure excludes deliveries with abnormal presentations.

Patients who do not receive prenatal care and have no documented gestational age or estimated due date are implicitly excluded from the measure, as gestational age is required to meet denominator criteria. 

This measure allows for 3 approaches to determine gestational age (GA) in the following order of precedence:

1.  The GA is calculated using the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ReVITALize guidelines.*
2.  When the calculated GA is not available, the GA is obtained from a discrete field in the electronic health record. The intent is to capture the last estimated GA in the interval starting 24 hours or less prior to delivery and ending before midnight on the same day of delivery.
3.  The GA is based on ICD10 or SNOMED codes indicative of weeks gestation.  This option is only used when results from items #1 and #2 (see above) are not available.
 
*ACOG ReVITALize Guidelines for Calculating Gestational Age (ACOG, 2014):      
     
               Gestational Age = (280-(EDD minus Reference Date))/7

--Estimated Due Date (EDD):  The best obstetrical Estimated Due Date is determined by last menstrual period if confirmed by early ultrasound or no ultrasound performed, or early ultrasound if no known last menstrual period or the ultrasound is not consistent with last menstrual period, or known date of fertilization (e.g., assisted reproductive technology) 
--Reference Date is the date on which you are trying to determine gestational age. For purposes of this eCQM, Reference Date would be the Date of Delivery.   

Note however the calculation may yield a non-whole number, and gestational age should be rounded off to the nearest completed week. For example, an infant born on the 5th day of the 36th week (35 weeks and 5/7 days) is at a gestational age of 35 weeks, not 36 weeks.

The timing relationship of relevantDatetime 42 weeks or less before TimeOfDelivery is applied to the data elements of parity, gravida, preterm/term live births for which prenatal records may include relevant information. 

Note: The eCQM and chart-based measure slightly digress in the denominator and denominator exclusion logic. The chart-based measure excludes single stillbirth and patients with multiple gestations from the denominator. These concepts are mutually exclusive of the denominator requirement of live singleton newborn and therefore the logic does not address single stillbirth nor multiple gestation.

Parity, preterm and term live births may be updated by the electronic health record software or by clinicians during a delivery encounter. To capture the pre-delivery value, organizations may need to create a rule or calculation to capture the number prior to the delivery start time.

&quot;Gravida&quot;, &quot;PretermBirth&quot;, &quot;TermBirth&quot; and &quot;Parity&quot; results should be submitted via QRDA I as integer, and not as number or quantity.

Definitions:  
Parity: The number of pregnancies reaching 20 weeks gestation regardless of the number of fetuses or outcomes
Gravidity: The number of pregnancies, current and past, regardless of the pregnancy outcome  
Preterm Birth: The number of births  &gt;= 20 weeks and &lt; 37 weeks gestation, regardless of outcome 
Term Birth: The number of births &gt;= 37 weeks gestation, regardless of outcome
Nulliparous: Parity = 0 or Gravidity = 1 or Preterm &amp; Term Births both = 0.

Note regarding Improvement Notation:  Decreased score indicates improvement - The Joint Commission does not want to encourage inappropriately low Cesarean rates that may be unsafe to patients. Acceptable PC-02 rates are 30% or lower, however there is not an established threshold for what rate may be too low. PC-06 serves as a balancing measure for PC-02 to guard against any unanticipated or unintended consequences and to identify unforeseen complications that might arise as a result of quality improvement activities and efforts for this measure. In order to identify areas for improvement, hospitals may want to review results based on specific ICD-10 codes or patient populations. Data could then be analyzed further determine specific patterns or trends to help reduce cesarean births.

This eCQM is an episode-based measure.  An episode is defined as each inpatient hospitalization or encounter that ends during the measurement period.

This FHIR-based measure has been derived from the QDM-based measure: CMS334v7. Please refer to the HL7 QI-Core Implementation Guide (https://hl7.org/fhir/us/qicore/STU4.1.1/) for more information on QI-Core and mapping recommendations from QDM to QI-Core 4.1.1 (https://hl7.org/fhir/us/qicore/STU4.1.1/qdm-to-qicore.html).</td>
